To enhance the model for predicting disease outbreaks, it is essential to collect more data and ensure its quality. Experimenting with different machine learning algorithms and utilizing hyperparameter tuning can improve accuracy. Addressing data imbalance through techniques like SMOTE is crucial. Implementing real-time deployment will make the model practically useful. Ensuring interpretability with methods like SHAP is necessary for transparency. Finally, addressing ethical considerations, such as bias mitigation and data privacy, will ensure the model is fair and secure. By implementing these improvements, the model's reliability and usability in predicting disease outbreaks can be significantly enhanced.
